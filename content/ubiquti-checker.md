# Ubiquiti Checker

### The problem

I need to purchase Ubiquiti products, but they’re always sold out. I’ve been on their official “subscribe to back in stock emails” list for months, but I’ve never received one. I know there’s services online that will text you when products are in stock, or I could depend on the r/UbiquitiInStock subreddit. But those are either paid or manual. Obviously I’m not going to pay money or check a subreddit when I can instead spend hours of my own time reinventing the wheel.

### The solution

So let’s waste some time (and time is money!) by building a bot that will check their site and text me if the products I want are in stock.

If I were buying a product normally, I would visit the product page on the company’s website, see if the button says “Add to Cart” and if it does, I know I can buy the item. So let’s make my bot behave the same way.

### The code

If I want to build a web scraper, there are two possibilities that come to mind. I could use a headless browser like Puppeteer or Selenium to visit the product page, but in this case, that would be overkill since I don’t need to interact with the site.

Since all I need is just to see if the page says sold out or not, and I’m not navigating around, I thought that simply having my bot get the page and look through it for keywords would be enough to determine whether a product is in stock.

## Code

Our program has a few requirements:

-   [ ] Go to our product page
-   [ ] Check whether the product is in stock
-   [ ] Notify me if the product is in stock
-   [ ] Run every 10 minutes

First, the bot visits the page by making a GET request.

We’ll use axios to make the request.

```js
const axios = require('axios')

axios
    .get(
        'https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect/products/g4-doorbell-pro'
    )
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result.data)
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error)
    })
```

At this point, the request will just return a large string of HTML with no easy way of looking through it. Obviously now we’ll do what any good JavaScript dev does: add a library to do it for us!

Let’s add node-html-parser to give us browser-like methods to query the DOM.

```js
const axios = require('axios')
const { parse } = require('node-html-parser')

axios
    .get(
        'https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect/products/g4-doorbell-pro'
    )
    .then((result) => {
        const root = parse(result.data)
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error)
    })
```

node-html-parser gives us access to the same methods as the browser, so we can query the page and look for anything that lets us know the product is in stock.

The next problem is knowing what to look for. If we compare a page for an in-stock product with one that’s sold out, we know that there’s a “Add to Cart” button on something we can buy.

Let’s look through the DOM for something that says “Add to Cart”

The transpiler hashes all the class names and ids. We can’t rely on these always being the same, though, so we’ll have to use something more consistent.

Luckily the button to purchase the item has a label on it, which is perfect.

```jsx
<button
    label="Add to Cart"
    class="sc-tjj6wi-2 gtzDPw sc-190ba8g-0 jasDXe"
    disabled="">
    <div class="sc-tjj6wi-0 iwrrep">
        <div class="sc-190ba8g-1 dDvBIF">
            <span>Add to Cart</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</button>
```

Let’s query for any button with a label of “Add to Cart”. If an element is found, it will return an the DOM object; otherwise it’ll be null. We’ll also throw in the title so we can use it later.

```jsx
...
  .then((result) => {
    const root = parse(result.data);
		const title = root.querySelector('title').text.split('-')[0].trim();
    const addToCart = root.querySelector('button[label="Add to Cart"]');
  })
...
```

Taking a look at our code, we can see that our bot now meets the first two requirements we had: it can visit a product page and check if that product is in stock.

-   [x] Go to our product page
-   [x] Check whether the product is in stock
-   [ ] Notify me if the product is in stock
-   [ ] Run every 10 minutes

Now the bot needs to notify me if the product is in stock. I’m going to go with texting since I want to know as soon as possible. You could switch this out for any type of notification, like email or even a push notification service. Since I've worked with Twilio’s API in the past, this is the quickest solution for me.

Let’s create a .env file to store any sensitive keys, and add two libraries: dotenv to read the env file and Twilio to send messages.

```jsx
require("dotenv").config();
const {
  TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID,
  TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN,
  TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER,
  TWILIO_TO_NUMBER,
} = process.env;
const axios = require("axios");
const { parse } = require("node-html-parser");
const twilio = require("twilio")(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN);
...
```

Now we can create a function using the Twilio library to send us a text.

```jsx
function sendText(message) {
    twilio.messages.create({
        body: message,
        from: TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER,
        to: TWILIO_TO_NUMBER,
    })
}
```

So now we can check number 3 off the list:

-   [x] Go to our product page
-   [x] Check whether the product is in stock
-   [x] Notify me if the product is in stock
-   [ ] Run every 10 minutes

Our project works! It can check a URL to see if a product is in stock, and text me when it is. But running this manually every 10 minutes isn’t any better then just visiting the website, so the final step is having it run automatically every 10 minutes.

Luckily someone smarter has already done the hard part, and we can just install another library: node-cron.

```jsx
const cron = require('node-cron');

...

cron.schedule('*/10 * * * *', () => {
  console.log('running a task every 10 minutes');
});
```

Let’s wrap our code into a function to clean it up a bit.

```jsx
function checkItem() {
    axios
        .get(
            'https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect/products/uvc-g4-doorbell'
        )
        .then((result) => {
            const root = parse(res.data)
            const title = root.querySelector('title').text.split('-')[0].trim()
            const addToCart = root.querySelector('button[label="Add to Cart"]')
            if (addToCart) sendText(`${title} is in stock`)
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            console.error(error)
        })
}
```

Now we just have to schedule it.

```jsx
cron.schedule('*/10 * * * *', () => {
    checkItem()
})
```

That’s the final item!

-   [x] Go to our product page
-   [x] Check whether the product is in stock
-   [x] Notify me if the product is in stock
-   [x] Run every 10 minutes

We're done! The bot now checks all the boxes. I could stop here and this would work most of the time, but there’s still a a few things we can improve to make the bot a little better.

## Checking multiple products

In its current form, our bot can check one product at a time. I could just create a new function for each product and schedule those, but we can make that a little cleaner.

Let’s create an array of urls for our products we want to check.

```jsx
const itemsToCheck = [
    'https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-smartpower/products/usp-pdu-pro',
    'https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect/products/g4-doorbell-pro',
    'https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect-accessories/products/smart-sensor',
    'https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-switching/products/usw-flex-mini',
]
```

If we want to make multiple requests with axios, our flow is a little different. We have to make each request, wait for them all to finish, then check on the stock status of each product.

Let’s create an empty list for our requests, and for each url we’ll add a request to that list.

```jsx
const requests = []

itemsToCheck.forEach((url) => {
    requests.push(axios.get(url))
})
```

Axios has a handy method that will take a list of requests, wait for them all to complete, and run some code per request.

```jsx
axios.all(requests).then((result) => {
    result.forEach((res) => {
        const root = parse(res.data)
        const title = root.querySelector('title').text.split('-')[0].trim()
        const addToCart = root.querySelector('button[label="Add to Cart"]')
        if (addToCart) sendText(`${title} is in stock`)
    })
})
```

Now we can check a whole list of products, and get notified whenever any of these products are in stock.

```jsx
...

const itemsToCheck = [
  "https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect/products/g4-doorbell-pro",
  "https://store.ui.com/us/en/products/uacc-adapter-dbpoe",
  "https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/category/all-cameras-nvrs/products/uacc-g5-enhancer"
];

function checkItems() {
  const requests = [];

  itemsToCheck.forEach((url) => {
    requests.push(axios.get(url));
  });

  axios.all(requests).then((result) => {
    result.forEach((res) => {
      const root = parse(res.data);
      const title = root.querySelector('title').text.split('-')[0].trim();
      const addToCart = root.querySelector('button[label="Add to Cart"]');
      if (addToCart) sendText(`${title} is in stock`);
    });
  });
}
...
```

There we go! We can now check multiple products and get notified if one of them is in stock.
